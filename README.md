This repository contains an end-to-end data pipeline project built to extract, transform, and load (ETL) SpaceX launch data using modern data engineering tools and best practices.
The pipeline is designed to be production-ready, containerized, and cloud-deployable. It orchestrates the flow of raw data ingestion, transformation, validation, and final loading into a data warehouse.
